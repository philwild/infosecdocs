##Introduction to the InfoSec app

![Security Posture](./Images/SecurityPosture.png)

The InfoSec app provides the user with a number of pre-configured and customisable security focussed dashboards and alerts. The InfoSec app focuses on the most common security focused technology components within your typical corporate environment, being:


* Firewall (including next-generation firewalls)
* Authentication (e.g. Active Directory and/or LDAP)
* Antivirus (including next-generation antivirus)

Focussing on these three security domains, the InfoSec app provides a comprehensive series of dashboards to help protect your network, users and intellectual property from external adversaries and malicious insider threats. It will help you investigate incidents and automate compliance tasks.

The InfoSec app also provides executive level reporting metrics, trends and summaries. The app can assist with meeting compliance requirements and completing audits faster through the use of customisable reports mapped to common compliance frameworks such as NIST HIPPA PCI and ISO.
