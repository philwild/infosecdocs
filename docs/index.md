#Welcome to the InfoSec app for Splunk!

The [InfoSec App for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4240/) is a free app for the Splunk platform which can be downloaded and installed into your Splunk environment. It is available from [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/).

The InfoSec App for Splunk should not to be confused with [Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/enterprise-security.html), Splunk's premium security solution. Although both solutions are security solutions, the features and capabilities of Enterprise Security are significantly deeper than what is available within the InfoSec app.

InfoSec app for Splunk is an entry, or starter level security solution powered by the Splunk platform. It is
designed to address the most common security use cases, including continuous monitoring and security investigations. The InfoSec app also includes a number of advanced threat detection use cases that can be further expanded using security resources available for Splunk like the [Security Essentials app for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3435/) from [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com). The Security Essentials app includes hundreds of additional security controls that can be easily integrated into the InfoSec app. Splunk's [Machine Learning Toolkit](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/) can be used to enable advanced ML based correlation searches within the InfoSec app to detect and alert on threats.

The Splunkbase library has 1000+ apps and add-ons from Splunk, our partners, and our community. They can be directly downloaded, installed and configured within your Splunk environment. Splunk Apps provide solutions for many common use cases. They provide specialised insight into your data and systems with pre-configured dashboards, reports, data inputs, and saved searches which can supplement or be integrated with the InfoSec app.

Please visit [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/) to see what is available.

Cyber Security is a journey, not a destination. The InfoSec app configuration steps and integrations with Security Essentials, the Common Information Model, and other Splunk apps and add-ons, are foundational steps towards the adoption of Splunk's Premium security platform, including [Enterprise Security](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/enterprise-security.html) and [Phantom](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-security-orchestration-and-automation.html).

##App Goals

The InfoSec app for Splunk aims to achieve the following:

* Provide an entry level security solution to new and existing Splunk customers that are not yet ready or able to invest in Splunk's Enterprise Security platform.
* Make it easy to direct Splunk's powerful features towards security.
* Provide a single pane view of your security events and posture.
* Allow the user to easily investigate security alerts and incidents.
* Provide a base security platform that can be customised and expanded to meet your security needs using the additional apps and add-ons from Splunkbase.
